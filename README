Abstract

A linear program with linear complementarity constraints (LPCC) requires the minimization of a linear objective over a set of linear constraints together with additional linear complementarity constraints. This class has emerged as a modeling paradigm for a broad collection of problems, including bilevel programs, Stackelberg games, inverse quadratic programs, and problems involving equilibrium constraints. The presence of the complementarity constraints results in a nonconvex optimization problem. We develop a branch-and-cut algorithm to find a global optimum for this class of optimization problems, where we branch directly on complementarities. We develop branching rules and feasibility recovery procedures and demonstrate their computational effectiveness in a comparison with CPLEX. The implementation builds on CPLEX through the use of callback routines. The computational results show that our approach is a strong alternative to constructing an integer programming formulation using big-$M$ terms to represent bounds for variables, with testing conducted on general LPCCs as well as on instances generated from bilevel programs with convex quadratic lower level problems.

Keywords: linear programs with complementarity constraints, MPECs, branch and cut 


======================================
Instruction for Generating Output Data
======================================

There are two classes of problems:
(1) 60 randomly generated LPCCs
(2) LPCCs generated from bilevel problems.

Generating the instances:
-------------------------
(1) 60 randomly generated LPCCs:
The instances are in the folder LPCC60probs/input_files.
The README.txt in the folder contains a description of the
instances together with a description of the input format.

The filenames end in dat.
The names of the instances give several parameters of the instance:
20101 to 20105: five instances with same parameters
2: n, the dimension of x (same for all instances).
100, 150, 200: m, dimension of y and w.
20: k, the number of rows of A, B and b (same for all instances).
30, 60, 100, 120: rank of M, constructed as LL^T.
20, 70: density of A, B, L, N.

A generator is not available for these instances. Pseudocode for
the generator can be found in Procedure 4 in the paper.

Basic data for the instances appears in Table 5, with performance
data in Table 6, both in the paper.

(2) LPCCs generated from bilevel problems:
The instances are in the folder bilevel_instances.
There are 50 instances in bilevel_no_seed
and 48 instances in bilevel43254seed.
The same README.txt file is in both subfolders.
The instances were generated using ampl, so there are
generate.mod, generate.dat, and generate.run files in
each subfolder.
The executable create_input_files in each subfolder will
recreate the set of instances.
Files of the form g..dat are original AMPL input files.
Files of the form bil..txt are the problem instances created
by AMPL, and are in an appropriate format for the code.


Solving the instances:
----------------------
The folder LPCC_source_code contains a Makefile along with
source code files in C and header files.
To create an executable, CPLEX libraries are needed.
The version used in the paper is CPLEX 12.6.2.
The Makefile is a modified version of the standard one distributed
with CPLEX, and must be edited to set correct values for SYSTEM,
LIBFORMAT, CPLEXDIR, CONCERTDIR, and the various compiler and
link options.
Once the Makefile has been appropriately edited, object files
and an executable LPCC can be created through the use of the
command make.

LPCC will read in problems in any of three formats. We only
provide example files in the third (compact) format.
The code is invoked using the command
LPCC -m b -f 3 input.txt
The "b" indicates the branch-and-cut code. To use unmodified
CPLEX, replace the "b" by "c".
The input file name can be anything, rather than our example
of input.txt. The output is written to [inputfilename].out

The instances are in different folders. A symbolic link
can be created from these folders to the exectuable LPCC
in order to solve each set of instances.

(1) 60 randomly generated LPCCs
The unix executable  runall_lpcc  will solve all the 60 problems
using the branch-and-cut code. Before invoking this command, the
input_files folder must be duplicated and renamed f3b.

The unix executable  runall_cplex  will solve all the 60 problems
using the unmodified CPLEX code. Before invoking this command, the
input_files folder must be duplicated and renamed f3c.

(2) LPCCs generated from bilevel problems.
In each of the subfolders to bilevel_instances, there are two
executable files: runbil_b and runbil_c.
runbil_b will run through the set of instances and solve
each of them using the branch-and-cut code.
runbil_c will run through the set of instances and solve
each of them using the unmodified CPLEX code.
Note that the output files are currently in the folders,
so if a user wants to recreate the output the user should
first duplicate the folder and then remove all the output
files.



Processing the output:
----------------------
(1) 60 randomly generated LPCCs:
The raw output files are in the directories cplex_output
and LPCCoutput. The LPCCoutput directory is the output
from the branch-and-cut code proposed in the paper,
while the cplex_output is from using unmodified cplex.

The excel spreadsheet basic_info_for_bin_probs_mac_pro.xlsx
contains all the information that appears in Tables 5 and 6
in the paper.

This data was collected by using the unix command grep on
the output files, editing the output from grep, and then
importing that information into excel.

The various .txt files in the output directories are the
files obtained from grep, after some editing.

(2) LPCCs generated from bilevel problems.
The output files are in the same folders as the input files.
Also in each folder is an excel spreadsheet containing
information about the output, imported from files obtained
by editing output from grep.

(*) Constructing performance profiles and scatter plots:
A python file was written to take two columns of raw data
as input (namely, runtimes for the two algorithms) and turn
this into a latex file. This file is in the folder
making_performance_profiles, along with sample input and
output files.
