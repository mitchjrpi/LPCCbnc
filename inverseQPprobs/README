Instances of inverse QP problems are modeled as LPCCs, as in
F. Jara-Moroni, J. S. Pang and A. Waechter, "A study of the
difference-of-convex approach for solving linear programs with
complementarity constraints", Mathematical Programming 2017.

The problems are set up using AMPL.
The AMPL run file generateinvQP.run generates random instances
using the parameters in sizes.mod and generateinvQP.dat, with
the model file in generateinvQP.mod.
The problem is written out to lpcc.txt in a format for the lpcc code.
The problem can also be solved as an integer program by entering
the ampl command
>solve MIP;

The set of instances in the subfolder were generated and solved
using the unix executable  solve_instances.txt.

The solver LPCCnpc is the LPCC code compiled so as to not
generate any cuts in the preprocessor; this requires editing
cutsgenerator.c.

The modified versions of cutsgenerator.c and cutsgenerator.h
can be found in this folder.
